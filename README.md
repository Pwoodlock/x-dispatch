## What it does

### Plan the flight on real airways

Pick departure and arrival, auto-route on real airways with SIDs and STARs, even across the North Atlantic Tracks. Edit the enroute string by hand and the map redraws as you type. Save straight to X-Plane as a .fms file.

### Weather you can see on the ground

Rain, snow, fog and wind blow across the airport straight from the live METAR. At night the airfield lights come on: runway, taxiway and approach lighting, including the sequenced flashers on final.

### Your aircraft, live on the map

While X-Plane runs, a symbol follows your aircraft from the globe down to the taxiway. The Flight Strip keeps speed, altitude, heading, COM1 and QNH on screen, on the map or in its own window over X-Plane, with click-through so it never gets between you and the cockpit. Press the map button and a heading-up taxi map tells you the next turn and where to hold short.

### Fly online with VATSIM and IVAO

Live traffic, sectors and staffed airports on the map. Click a pilot to see their route, then hand their filed plan to the planner with one button.

![VATSIM](screenshots/vatsim-plan.png)

### Search any ICAO. Jump there.

35,000 airports on a 3D globe with nav aids, airspaces and live weather underneath. Four basemaps built in (Dark, Light, Light + 3D, Satellite) plus bring-your-own style URL. Star favorites and set a home airport.

### 3D terrain

Hillshade and real elevation under the map, so mountain airports like Innsbruck read the way they should. ILS glide slopes are drawn in 3D above the runway.

### Real airport diagrams

Layouts pulled straight from your X-Plane install: runways, taxiways, gates, painted lines, lighting, custom scenery. Click any frequency in the info panel and it tunes COM1 or COM2 in the sim.

### Configure the flight at the gate

Aircraft, livery, fuel, payload, weather, time of day. Set up the whole flight before the sim opens, launch X-Plane directly or relocate mid-flight.

![Flight Setup](screenshots/flight-setup.png)

### SimBrief and flight plans on the globe

Fetch the latest OFP, review route, weights and fuel, drop the FMS file into your sim folder. Load any FMS file and the route draws on the globe. Export in the format your aircraft expects: X-Plane FMS, MSFS PLN and others.

### Logbook

Every flight recorded automatically with trail, landing detection, replay and landing statistics.

![Logbook](screenshots/log-book.png)

### Companion apps and add-ons in one place

Register companion apps (XPME, ATC clients, hardware drivers) and X-Dispatch launches them with X-Plane. Browse aircraft, plugins, liveries, Lua scripts and scenery priority across multiple X-Plane installs. Drop a file in and the installer figures out where it goes.

> **Don't own X-Plane?** X-Plane has a [free demo](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/try-it/) that works with X-Dispatch, so you can try both.
